I was assigned the following task during my time at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.

    ## Overview

    In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock 
    from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing
    departments in the store.

    Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.


To accomplish this task, I used mySQL to sort a database of products keeping track of the product name, department name, price, and stock. I then created a manager app that allows to
add products, and manipulate the values of any data type.
